/**
 * Higher Order Functions
 * HOF are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
 * HOF is a function that receives a function as an argument. ie. const hof1 = (fn) => fn(5); hof1((x) => x)
 * HOF is a function that returns the function as output. ie. const hof2 = () => () => 1; hof2()();
