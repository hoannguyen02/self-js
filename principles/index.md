1. DRY: Don't repeat yourself   
    * Try to automate/dynamic it instead of copy & paste the same code
2. KISS: Keep it simple, Stupid
    * Try not make the code complicated
    * Keep it short, small & simple
3. YAGNI: You aren't gonna need it
    * Try to do simplest things that can work, but can easy to improve later on 
    * Features only added when required to avoid wasted effort
    * Some features are many not used
